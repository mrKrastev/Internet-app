## Things to check out when exploring LostAndFound

- **Click "Check what we found!" link to see the items. Try doing any of the functions on the screen**
- **Create an account by using the register button at the top or use my test accounts [email:da@da.com password:12345678] and [email:ne@ne.com password:87654321]**
- **see details about items, and try requesting them. Request same items twice with the same user account (it shouldnt let you) Note: I requested the 2 items with my test accounts **
- **Add new items, try adding multiple pictures if you want. (hold ctrl while selecting images to upload)**
- **Open up the item you have added and confirm the information by clicking the Logo at the left top corner (it takes you to the first page) and then the hyperlink again**
- **filter the table based on category using the dropdown menu and the refresh button**
- **check out the admin account which has more access than a user account. use: [email:admin@admin.com password:admin]**
- **See items by doing the same as above but you should also be able to delete and edit items. (i recommend making a new item, then editing and deleting it)**
- **See requests button should appear. Clicking it should take you to a screen showing you all requests made. You should be able to see the requests you made earlier if you made an account or an item and requested it**
- **Click review request to access a screen which shows you a bit of information about the request and an option to change the status. Change the status and go back to see the result**
- **You can also delete requests**
Thank you
